**WEEK 1**
1. <ins>Check Brackets in the Code</ins>:
   
   - *Description*: Priority is to find the first unmatched closing bracket which either does not have an opening bracket before it - like "]" in "]()" - or closes the wrong opening bracket - like "}" in "()[}". If there are no such mistakes, then it should find the first unmatched opening bracket without the corresponding closing bracket after it - like "(" in "{}([]". If there are no mistakes, the text editor should inform the user that brackets are correct.
  
   - *Input Format*: Input contains one string 𝑆 which consists of big and small Latin letters, digits, punctuation marks and brackets from the set "[]{}()".
  
   - *Constraints*: The length of 𝑆 is at least 1 and at most 105.
  
   - *Output Format*: If the code in 𝑆 uses brackets correctly, output “Success" (without the quotes). Otherwise,
output the 1-based index of the first unmatched closing bracket, and if there are no unmatched closing
brackets, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched opening bracket.
